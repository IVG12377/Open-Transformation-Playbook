# Open Transformation Playbook

Open-source transformation frameworks and tools developed through 15+ years of Fortune 500 transformation leadership. Practical alternatives to expensive, gated methodologies.

## What This Is

A collection of battle-tested frameworks, Excel-based tools, and case studies from fixing transformations with 70% failure rates.  
No theory. No certifications required. Just what works.

**Built from experience across:**
- 5+ post-merger integrations ($500Mâ€“$2B)  
- 10+ operating model redesigns  
- Multiple digital transformations  
- Integrated transformations (M&A + digital + operating model simultaneously)  

## Why Open Source

The transformation industry hides its best practices behind $3,995 certifications and $2M consulting engagements.  
Meanwhile, 70% of transformations fail using these same "proven" approaches.  

This playbook changes that.  

## What's Inside

## Quick Start

**For Transformation Leaders**
1. Start with [Change Readiness Assessment](./frameworks/change-readiness-assessment.md)  
2. Map resistance using [Stakeholder Patterns](./frameworks/stakeholder-resistance-patterns.md)  
3. Track adoption using [Tools](./tools/)  

**For Consultants**
- Frameworks are customizable, no license barriers  
- Tools are unlocked, modify as needed  
- Attribution appreciated but not required  

**For Skeptics**
- Start with the [Integrated Transformation Case](./case-studies/integrated-transformation.md)  
- Compare what failed vs. what worked  
- See how results differ from traditional consulting

## The Approach

Rejecting traditional change management theater in favor of:  
- **Data over intuition** â€“ Monte Carlo, resistance patterns  
- **Adoption over process** â€“ Measuring outcomes, not activity  
- **Integration over isolation** â€“ M&A + digital + operating model together  
- **Transparency over gatekeeping** â€“ Open methodologies improve success rates
