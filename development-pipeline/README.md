# Frameworks in Practice

Battle-tested methodologies from 15+ years fixing transformations. Designed to work individually or together for complex, integrated transformations.

## Context

Research consistently shows high failure rates:  
- 70% of transformations fail (McKinsey)  
- 80% of digital transformations miss objectives (Gartner)  
- 70‚Äì90% of M&A integrations don‚Äôt achieve synergies  

These frameworks address the repeatable patterns behind those failures.

## Available Frameworks

### ‚úÖ [Stakeholder Resistance Patterns](./stakeholder-resistance-patterns.md)  
*Status: Complete*  

The 5 resistance patterns that predict transformation failure. Based on research showing why employees resist change (41% mistrust, 39% lack of awareness).  

**Best for:** M&A integrations, digital adoption, culture change  
**Applied across:** Multiple post-merger integrations and digital transformations

### üìù [Change Readiness Assessment](./change-readiness-assessment.md)  
*Status: Documentation in progress*  

Quantitative assessment of organizational capacity for change before committing resources. Prevents overloading organizations with more change than they can absorb.  

**Best for:** Multiple concurrent changes, post-failure recovery  
**Applied across:** Operating model redesigns in financial services and healthcare

### üìù [Transformation Health Indicators](./transformation-health-indicators.md)  
*Status: Documentation in progress*  

12-point early warning system that identifies issues 2‚Äì3 months before traditional metrics. Provides predictive insight rather than reactive reporting.  

**Best for:** Complex programs, board-level initiatives  
**Applied across:** Enterprise programs ranging from $5M‚Äì50M investments

## Application

- **Single transformation:** Apply the relevant framework directly  
- **Integrated transformation:** Use all three in sequence  
  1. Assess readiness (prevent overload)  
  2. Map resistance patterns (target interventions)  
  3. Monitor health indicators (catch issues early)  

See the [Integrated Transformation Case Study](../field-notes-case-studies/integrated-transformation.md) for a detailed example.
