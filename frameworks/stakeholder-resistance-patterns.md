# Stakeholder Resistance Patterns Framework

*Full documentation coming September 2025. This is a preview.*

## The 5 Patterns That Kill Transformations

Based on research showing 41% resist due to mistrust, 39% due to lack of awareness:

1. **Silent Sabotage** - Yes in meetings, no in practice
2. **Resource Starvation** - Support without resources  
3. **Complexity Theater** - Simple made complex
4. **Historical Anchoring** - "We tried this before"
5. **Malicious Compliance** - Letter not spirit

Full framework with detection and intervention strategies coming soon.
